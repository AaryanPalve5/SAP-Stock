Click here to access exclusive investment research and ad-free browsing!\"\n2. \"Click here to access exclusive research!\"\n3. Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?\nPublished on November 9, 2024 at 2:08 pm by Maleha Afzal\nin Hedge Funds,\nNews\nShare\nTweet\nEmail\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\n\nIs Corporate America Celebrating the New Administration?\nOn November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years.\n\nNow that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House.\n\nMcLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment.\n\nMcLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to \u201cswitch course\u201d.\n\nOn the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close.\n\nDatta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds, \"We are looking at the stocks that the hedge funds pile into\".\n\nDatta further says, \"Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\".\n\nA row of electric cars being charged simultaneously at a public charging station.\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company specializing in producing electric cars and solar-integrated renewable energy solutions. The company is one of the largest EV manufacturers in the United States.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) logged revenue worth $25.18 billion, up by 8% year-over-year. Automotive revenues accounted for most of the revenue, at $20.02 billion. Overall, revenue was driven by increasing vehicle deliveries. Previously, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) launched a new lineup of electric vehicles to boost the launch of new models. Its new lineup and extensive production line will deliver over 3 million vehicles of capacity when optimized fully.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) boasts solid growth potential over the next few years. On October 28, John Murphy, senior automotive analyst at Bank of America, appeared in an interview on Yaho Here is the extracted information:\n\nNews/Articles:\n\n1. Tesla's stance on electric and autonomous vehicles, as stated by Murphy.\n2. Tesla's growing gross margins, which will fund its future plans, including self-driving and robotics.\n3. Tesla's strong core and solid opportunity curve.\n\nInvestor Letters:\n\n1. Baron Funds' Q2 2024 investor letter discussing Tesla's products and growth prospects.\n\nRankings:\n\n1. Tesla ranks 8th on the list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.\n\nOther:\n\n1. A report about the cheapest AI stock (not fully extracted, as it's not provided in the text).\n2.

Li Auto Stock\u2019s Selloff Justified as Trump Vows to Raise Tariffs\n   \"In This Article: BYDDF BYDDY RIVN NIO NIOIF Li Auto (LI) stock is down more than 7% in Friday\u2019s trading session. The selloff appeared to be a direct reaction to the U.S. election result, with president-elect Donald Trump vowing to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. However, Li Auto doesn\u2019t export to the U.S. and doesn\u2019t have plans to. As such, I think the selloff is unwarranted. More broadly, I think the stock is oversold and undervalued based on projected earnings growth. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bullish.\"\n2. Trump's Tariffs\n   \"Donald Trump is the president-elect and tariffs are going to be headline news when he takes to the White House. While his exact plans for vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) are uncertain, the former president said he\u2019d look to implement tariffs of 100% or even 200% on Chinese-made vehicles entering the U.S. market. This aggressive stance is part of Trump\u2019s broader strategy to protect the American auto industry and address concerns about Chinese competition.\"\n3. Li Auto's Plans to Expand Outside the U.S.\n   \"However, a reason why I am bullish on Li Auto is because its global expansion strategy appears to be focused on markets outside the United States, with a particular emphasis on the Middle East. According to reports, the company planned to enter overseas markets starting in 2024, targeting countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\"\n4. Trump's Proposed Tariffs Could Be a Big Hit to Discount Retailers, Footwear Companies\n   \"Trump's proposed tariffs could be a big hit to discount retailers, footwear companies\"\n5. Wall Street Scores Political Victory with a Trump Win: 'This Should Aid All Banks'\n   \"Wall Street scores political victory with a Trump win: 'This should aid all banks'\" Here is the extracted information:\n\n\"Reports now suggest that the company has pushed its export plan back further, focusing on its position in the Chinese luxury EV market.\n\nChina's EV market is the biggest globally, with sales surging 82% in 2023 and capturing nearly 60% of global EV purchases. Overall, China\u2019s EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.15% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nLi Auto targets the higher end of the market and this tends to be a more resilient part of the economy. Indeed, Li Auto\u2019s cheapest vehicle \u2014 the L6 \u2014 sells for around $34,000, a similar price to Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Model Y, which is not cheap in a poorer country like China.\n\nLi Auto has continued to deliver impressive growth despite what many consider to be a faltering economy. The firm delivered 51,443 vehicles in October 2024, up 27.3% year-over-year.\n\nDespite this volume growth, Li Auto\u2019s earnings are expected to fall in 2024. That largely reflects some softening of margins and higher costs due to the introduction of new models. Still, I remain positive on the stock because earnings growth is expected to return to 36% in 2025 and 42% in 2026.\n\nLi auto is still a good value stock. At the time of writing, the stock is trading around 20.4x forward price-to-earnings ratio. \n\nMy Portfolios\nMy Portfolios\nSign in to access your portfolio\nSign in\n\nTop Gainers\nSEZL\nSezzle Inc.\n431.48\n+181.01\n(+72.27%)\nUPST\nUpstart Holdings, Inc.\n81.00\n+25.53\n(+46.02%)\nDOCS\nDoximity, Inc.\n58.25\n+14.83\n(+34.15%)\nFTRE\nFortrea Holdings Inc.\n23.50\n+5.45\n(+30.19%)\nTEM\nTempus AI, Inc\n73.77\n+16.98\n(+29.90%)\n\nTop Losers\nASTH\nAstrana Health, Inc.\n46.96\n-12.12\n(-20.51%)\nAKAM\nAkamai Technologies, Inc.\n89.37\n-15.03\n(-14.40%)\nWMS\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\n136.16\n-22.84\n(-14.36%)\nPINS\nPinterest, Inc.\n29.18\n-4.75\n(-14.00%)\nIOVA\nIovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n10.59\n-1.69\n(-13.80%)\n\nMost Active\nTSLA\nTesla, Inc.\n321.22\n+24.31\n(+8.19%)\nNVDA\nNVIDIA Corporation\n147.63\n-1.25\n(-0.84%)\nDJT\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp.\n31.91\n+4.22\n(+15.22%)\nLCID\nLucid Group, Inc.\n2.2100\n-0.0100\n(-0.45%)\nSOFI\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\n13.01\n+1.11\n(+9.33%)\n\nTrending Tickers\nBTC-USD\nBitcoin USD\n78,859.37\n+2,463.81\n(+3.23%)\nDOGE-USD\nDogecoin USD\n0.23\n+0.03\n(+14.08%)\nETH-USD\nEthereum USD\n3,174.59\n+201.67\n(+6.78%)\nSHIB-USD\nShiba Inu USD\n0.00\n+0.00\n(+21.14%)\nADA-USD\nCardano USD\n0.57\n+0.14\n(+32.54%)"
